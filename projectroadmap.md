# Preparation Phase
- [ ] Making a Flowchart model to retain a better understanding of the way our code would work
- [ ] Checking to make sure we have all of our hardware components (Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Jumper Wires, and PIR Motion Sensor)
- [ ] Setting up the Raspberry Pi 3 so that it is functional 
- [ ] Creating a gmail account for user login
- [ ] Deciding on which phone will be used to recieve the warning message
- [ ] Create carrier specific email address that will be able to receive the messages

# Coding Phase   
- [ ] Make sure that the Python code is recognized in Python IDLE (on a Raspberry Pi)
- [ ] Modify existing code to match our preference 
- [ ] Import modified code into Github repository


# Testing Phase

# Final Phase
- [ ] Create a powerpoint for the project
