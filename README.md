# Text Intruder Alarm System
A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B will be used to create an intruder alarm that sends a text message warning to the owner of a smartphone device with text messaging (SMS) capabilities. The language used to run the program is Python 3.7.4 at the time this project was developed. In order for the intruder alarm to work, a passive infrared (PIR) sensor is required to sense intruders presence at a certain distance.
